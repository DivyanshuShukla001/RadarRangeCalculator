A radar range calculator code snippet would involve calculating the distance between a radar system and a target based on the time it takes for the radar signal to travel to the target and back. This involves using the speed of light and the round-trip time of the radar signal.

Here is an example code snippet in Python:

```python
def radar_range_calculator(time):
    # Speed of light in meters per second
    speed_of_light = 299792458
    
    # Calculate distance using formula: distance = (speed * time) / 2
    distance = (speed_of_light * time) / 2
    
    return distance

# Example usage
time_to_target = 0.00000001  # Time in seconds (adjust as needed)
distance_to_target = radar_range_calculator(time_to_target)
print(f"The distance to the target is approximately {distance_to_target} meters.")
```

Explanation:

1. The `radar_range_calculator` function takes the round-trip time `time` as input.

2. It uses the speed of light (approximately 299,792,458 meters per second) to calculate the distance to the target based on the formula `distance = (speed * time) / 2`.

3. The function returns the calculated distance.

4. In the example usage, you provide a round-trip time `time_to_target` (in seconds) and call the function to get the estimated distance to the target.

Remember, this is a basic example. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider factors like signal processing delays, calibration, and potential environmental effects.

If you have specific requirements or additional context for the radar range calculator, please provide more information so I can tailor the code accordingly.
